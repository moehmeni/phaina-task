Given the following news:
{{news}}
Give me **one combo-style newsletter title** that includes **three short, punchy phrases**, separated by semicolons. The title should:

- Highlight the **three biggest or most interesting AI news stories** from the text I provide,
- Include **company names**, **funding amounts** (e.g. "$100M Series B"), or **specific product/feature names** when relevant,
- Be **clever, specific, and intriguing** â€” like a professional journalist/editor wrote it,
- Avoid vague or generic phrases like "AI is changing everything",
- Be **no longer than ~15 words total**,
- Use **no emojis**, no fluff, and **return only the title**.

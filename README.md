# phaina-task
A curated newsletter about AI agents

### Resources
At the first step of this task, I'm going to note all the useful and actively maintained
AI agent libraries.
Using a deep research option of Grok chat bot and also searching myself, I found these providers:

n8n:\
Many developers publish their n8n workflows which is a form of node based agent building
https://n8n.io/workflows/

Ai Agent List:\
Another directory for Ai agents with their specs
https://aiagentslist.com/?sort=createdAt.desc

### Content
I came to three main parts to show in the emails:
1. New AI Agents - recent releases or updates
2. Trend Spotlight - emerging trends withitn new agents
3. Agent of the Week - picked by multiple LLMs based on novelty etc.

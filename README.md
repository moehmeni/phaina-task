A curated newsletter about AI agents

### Resources
#### Agents
At the first step of this task, I'm going to note all the useful and actively maintained
AI agent libraries.
Using a deep research option of Grok chat bot and also searching myself, I found these providers:

n8n:\
Many developers publish their n8n workflows which is a form of node based agent building
https://n8n.io/workflows/

AI Agent List:\
Another directory for Ai agents with their specs

#### News
For fetching the latest news about AI agents I used Google Gemini 2.5 flash model with their builtin search tool as they have explained the API tools and how it works in detail [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search).

I tried multiple prompts to get a suitable output with least amount of work, so at the end this prompt gave me good results:
> *Gather all the latest news in July about AI agents and new workflows, make up to 10 concise one paragraph easy-to-read friendly brief of what happened.Â 
Make sure the paragraphs are not ChatGPT style and like a pro human reviewer wrote them! each paragraph starts with a summarised title about the content of that paragraph in bold and next line starts the content. DO NOT make general titles and be specific about it (numbers, company names, anything clickbait)
please include the use and ability of each agent exactly if mentioned.*

### Content
I came to three main parts to show in the emails:
1. New AI Agents - recent releases or updates
2. Trend Spotlight - emerging trends withitn new agents
3. Agent of the Week - picked by multiple LLMs based on novelty etc.
